# Customer

This project demonstrates Inheritance using two classes in Java.

The superclass named Person contains fields for holding a peron's name, address, and telephone number.

The sublclass named Customer extends the Person class. The Customer class contains a field for a customer number and a boolean field indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list.

An object of the Customer class is demonstrated in a simple program named CustomerDemo.
